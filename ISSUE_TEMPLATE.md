#### Description of the problem:



**Which library version are you using?** E.g. 3.2.0.

**Which phone/tablet are you using, and which Android version does it run? (e.g. Samsung Galaxy S5,
  Android 5.0)**

**Does the same happen on other devices or an emulator?**

**Can you reproduce the issue in the sample project included with the library? If not, can you
  provide your own sample project or sample code that produces this error?**

**In the case of an error do you have a stack trace or adb logs?**

<!--
If you have an issue scanning specific barcodes, please test with the Barcode Scanner application,
available on the Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android&hl=en

If you are also not able to scan the barcode there, the issue may be with the underlying zxing library,
in which case you should report the issue here: https://github.com/zxing/zxing/issues
-->

<!--
If you have a question on usage of the library, please check the documentation and sample
application first:
